## What is a Foddian game?
The term *Foddian* first began with a game titled [Getting Over it with Bennett Foddy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/240720/Getting_Over_It_with_Bennett_Foddy/), which then spawned successors such as [Pogostuck](https://store.steampowered.com/app/688130/Pogostuck_Rage_With_Your_Friends/), and [Jump King](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061090/Jump_King/). These three games are all 2D platformers in which players use an easy-to-learn but hard-to-master movement mechanic to traverse one large, continuous level. The main appeal to these games is that extremely large chunks of progress can be lost with single mistakes, which leads to a punishing yet extremely rewarding gameplay loop as players try their best to regain their progress and continue forward (or, in most cases, upwards.)
